You can use `Mojinterpreter.py` as a module in your programs for making them funny for public.
We already have a telegram bot that can do this operation and its source is in "MojiPy.py". Currently its username is: [@MojiPy_bot](https://t.me/MojiPy_bot)

## How to use MojiPy?
There are two functions in this program. dinterpret and interpret. The first one is for converting all of the given python code keywords to emojies.
Note that keywords that are covered with quotes won't change.

The second one interprets emojies to python keywords and saves other characters in the code...
Example:
```python
import Mojinterpreter
string = "print('Hey moji')"
string = Mojinterpreter.dinterpret(string)
print(string)
```
